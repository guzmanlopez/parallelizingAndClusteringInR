# Parallel computing and clusters with R
This script is an example of performing parallel computing on clusters with R language using `parallel` package. The example is based on `krige` function of the `gstat` package with `meuse` dataset.

The aim of this script is that you can customite it to your needs! Also the aim is to speed up time consuming functions using all your cores of your computers or other computers processors.

**Note:** to make a cluster, you have to be able to access the other PCs via SSH.
